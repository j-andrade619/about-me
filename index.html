<h2>Sugar and my insecurities</h2>
<p>
    Hello! I am Jesse, and I am writing this "about me" summary in order to complete a project.
    I love non-sugar type drinks and was very happy when the major soft drink makers started referring
    to their "diet" soft drinks as "zero sugar". It made me feel more secure in my life choices because no one
    wants to be the one on a "diet". Even though I prefer diet coke's taste more than the taste of coke zero.

<h2> BAD JUJU and other things I learned in New Orleans</h2>
<p>
    At this point in the day I am tired, and I have really nothing to say about myself. I once heard
    that talking about yourself is "bad juju". I kind of took this seriously. However, because
    "bad juju" isn't scientific I ignored the warning. Now that I think about it,
    this could be the reason for my bad luck.

<h2>Not a real web developer.... yet.</h2>
<p>
    I'm not a professional web developer; I am aspiring to become one. My lack of experience could be seen in
    how long it took me to get a jpeg to show up properly on this web page. I got the hang of it now. </p>
